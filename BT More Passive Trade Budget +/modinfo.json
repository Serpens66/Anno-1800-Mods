  "Description": {
    "Chinese": "Increases the passive Trade budget from AI merchants and opponents (15k to 300k), but reduces TradeFleet and every merchant ship has capacity of 40t to compensate for high budget. This way you will be able to also buy/sell high valued goods from passive traders (if they have in in stock), but only always only up to 40t (8*5) of everything at max. This amount reduction also prevents the merchants to buy all goods from AI-players, refusing you to get a discount from AI players. I recommend my mod |No AI-Merchant Trade| to solve that problem and my other Balanced Trading Mods.",

    "German": "Erhöht das passive Handelsbudget von den Händlern und KI Mitspielern (15k bis 300k) und passt die Handelsflotte an:\nReduziert die TradeFleet massiv auf insg. 3 Schiffe in der alten Welt, 2 in neuer Welt, 2 in Africa und 1 in Rest. Außerdem haben alle Schiffe eine maximale Kapazität von 40 Tonnen (8*5).\nAuf diese Weise können durch das höhere Budget auch teurere Waren gehandelt werden, aber durch die Mengenlimitierung kaufen die Händler bei KI Mitspielern dennoch nicht alles weg, sodass ihr selbst dennoch von den günstigeren Preise bei KI Mitpsielern profitieren könnt. Ich empfehle dazu meinen |No AI-Merchant Trade| Mod, sowie meine anderen Balanced Trading mods.",
