  "Description": {
    "Chinese": "Balanced the price merchants pay for preferred goods from *3.2 to *1.6 for goods of the same session and *2.4 (or for cheap products *3.2) for goods from another session (also decreases the reputation gain from same-session goods a bit). Reduced the rabatte you get from AI and human players when trading in their harbour from 0.8/2 to 0.9/1.6, which is still quite good. It also means that passive trading for humans is cheaper than active trading with neutral merchants. Reduces the money buy-price for Items by ~half (meant to play on low earnings setting). Sell prices for items are nearly non exisitent, instead use the researchpoints feature to sell them for researchpoints.",

    "German": "Balanced die Preise die Händler für bevorzugte Waren zahlen: *1.6 vom Basipreis anstatt *3.2 für Waren aus derselben Session und *2.4 (bzw. *3.2 für sehr günstige Waren) für Waren aus anderen Sessions (reduziert auch den Rufzuwachs beim Handel mit selber-Session Waren). Der Rabatt den man beim Handel mit KI und menschlichen Mitspielern bekommt, wurde von 0.8/2 zu 0.9/1.6 reduziert, was immernoch sehr gut ist. Das heißt auch dass passiver Handel für den Spieler besser als aktiver Handel am Kontor von neutralen Händlern ist. Reduziert den Geld Kaufpreis von Items um die Hälfte (ist für Spiele mit niedrigen Einkommen gedacht). Verkaufspreise von Items sind extrem gering, nutze stattdessen das Spenden von Items gegen Forschungspunkte.",
