  "Description": {
    "Chinese": "平衡了商家为同一会话商品的首选商品支付的价格从 *3.2 到 *1.6，对另一个会话的商品支付的价格从 *2.4（或廉价商品 *3.2）平衡（也会稍微降低同一时段商品的声誉增益）。减少了商家部分商品的发行金额。将你在 AI 和人类玩家的港易时从 0.8/2 获得的拉巴特减少到 0.9/1.6，这仍然相当不错。这也意味着人类的被动交易比与中立商人的主动交易便宜。将物品的货币购买价格降低~一半（意味着在低收益设置下玩）。物品的出售价格几乎不存在，而是使用研究点功能出售它们以获得研究点。",
    "English": "Balanced the price merchants pay for preferred goods from *3.2 to *1.6 for goods of the same session and *2.4 (or for cheap products *3.2) for goods from another session (also decreases the reputation gain from same-session goods a bit). Reduced the offering amounts from some goods from the merchants. Reduced the rabatte you get from AI and human players when trading in their harbour from 0.8/2 to 0.9/1.6, which is still quite good. It also means that passive trading for humans is cheaper than active trading with neutral merchants. Reduces the money buy-price for Items by ~half (meant to play on low earnings setting). Sell prices for items are nearly non exisitent, instead use the researchpoints feature to sell them for researchpoints.",

    "German": "Balanced die Preise die Händler für bevorzugte Waren zahlen: *1.6 vom Basipreis anstatt *3.2 für Waren aus derselben Session und *2.4 (bzw. *3.2 für sehr günstige Waren) für Waren aus anderen Sessions (reduziert auch den Rufzuwachs beim Handel mit selber-Session Waren). Die Angebotsmenge von einigen Waren der Händler reduziert. Der Rabatt den man beim Handel mit KI und menschlichen Mitspielern bekommt, wurde von 0.8/2 zu 0.9/1.6 reduziert, was immernoch sehr gut ist. Das heißt auch dass passiver Handel für den Spieler besser als aktiver Handel am Kontor von neutralen Händlern ist. Reduziert den Geld Kaufpreis von Items um die Hälfte (ist für Spiele mit niedrigen Einkommen gedacht). Verkaufspreise von Items sind extrem gering, nutze stattdessen das Spenden von Items gegen Forschungspunkte.",
