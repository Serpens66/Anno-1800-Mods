  "Description": {
    "Chinese": "Balanced the price merchants pay for preferred goods from *3.2 to *1.6 for goods of the same session and *2.4 (or for cheap products *3.2) for goods from another session (also decreases the reputation gain from same-session goods a bit). Reduced the rabatte you get from AI players when trading in their harbour from 0.8/2 to 0.9/1.6, which is still quite good.",

    "German": "Balanced die Preise die Händler für bevorzugte Waren zahlen: *1.6 vom Basipreis anstatt *3.2 für Waren aus derselben Session und *2.4 (bzw. *3.2 für sehr günstige Waren) für Waren aus anderen Sessions (reduziert auch den Rufzuwachs beim Handel mit selber-Session Waren). Der Rabatt den man beim Handel mit KI Mitspielern bekommt, wurde von 0.8/2 zu 0.9/1.6 reduziert, was immernoch sehr gut ist.",
