1.01 
- fixed a typo which prevented Nate in Kap to buy new goods
- extracted Cargo Liner into seperated mod
- extracted TradeFleet Changes into More Passive Trade Budget + Mod.
1.02
- Thirds (reduced) the Goods Production for the 3 merchants in old world. Since they are 3 in same region, it should be less than in worls with only 1 merchant.
1.03:
- extracted many things into seperated mods. This mod does only:
  Balanced the price merchants pay for preferred goods from *3.2 to *1.6 for goods of the same session and *2.4 (or for cheap products *3.2) for goods from another session (also decreases the reputation gain from same-session goods a bit). Reduced the rabatte you get from AI players when trading in their harbour from 0.8/2 to 0.9/1.6, which is still quite good.
