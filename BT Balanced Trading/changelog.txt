1.01 
- fixed a typo which prevented Nate in Kap to buy new goods
- extracted Cargo Liner into seperated mod
- extracted TradeFleet Changes into More Passive Trade Budget + Mod.
1.02
- Thirds (reduced) the Goods Production for the 3 merchants in old world. Since they are 3 in same region, it should be less than in worls with only 1 merchant.
1.03:
- extracted many things into seperated mods. This mod does only:
  Balanced the price merchants pay for preferred goods from *3.2 to *1.6 for goods of the same session and *2.4 (or for cheap products *3.2) for goods from another session (also decreases the reputation gain from same-session goods a bit). Reduced the rabatte you get from AI players when trading in their harbour from 0.8/2 to 0.9/1.6, which is still quite good.
1.04:
- adjusted tradeprices of goods for human-to-human trading the same like already with AI players. This way the seller will get a bit better price than selling to third party and the buyer still gets better price than buying from third party.
1.05:
- Removed double products from the same merchants: Sarmento was passivley selling canons, while buyig them back on high price. Same with pirates and Rum. This was vanilla nonsense.
- Reduced buying and selling prices for Items. Sell them for researchpoints instead.
1.06:
- Reduced some vanilla Offering Goods Production
1.07:
- reduced vanilla production of Aluminium of Sarmento (and makes them also available in EndGame).
- vanilla fix for Bauxit in Endgame for Archibald (if my mod More Offering is not active)
