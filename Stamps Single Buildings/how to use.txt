These are stamps of each single building from the vanilla game, mostly a single building per stamp.
You can use these as blueprints to plan ahead directly from the game start.
Farms and other buildings that have modules that are not unlocked from the start, do also have the modules in the stamp, eg. tractor. This way you can even plan your silo and tractor of farms ahead while not having them unlocked yet.
I put ZZ and other letters in front of the folders and stamp names, to order them.


Installation:
Copy the content of this folder (the session named folders) into your:
\Documents\Anno 1800\stamps
folder. After this you should see the stamps ingame, sorted by citizen tier.

Uninstall:
Delete all folders in your stamps folder that start with "ZZ".


Minor Problems:
1) The stamps don't "snap" into correct position, you must move it exactly to a valid location and rotate them correclty.  This is especially with mines and clay a bit confusing.
2) Riverslot buildings in Enbasa: You must place the bigger main building correclty on spot. The minor building will then be placed correctly. If you place the minor building and the bigger does not spawn, try again to place the bigger one correctly.


Recommended Mod:
Better Pipette and Stamp Tool -> this mod allows you to copy and stamp buildings you did not unlock yet. This makes planning in early game when not having many buildings unlocked much easier.
