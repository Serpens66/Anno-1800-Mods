    "Chinese": "The Influence-TradeBuff does now not only increase the speed from tradships, but from all ships and is slightly higher (10/20/35 instead of 7/15/25). I recommend my other mod -Attainments by Research- to research these buffs instead.",

    "German": "Der Einfluss-TradeBuff erhöht nun nicht nur von Handelsschiffen die Geschwindigkeit, sondern von allen Schiffen und ist ein wenig höher (10/20/35 anstelle von 7/15/25). Ich empfehle noch meinen -Attainments by Research- Mod, um diese Buffs stattdessen mit Forschungspunkten zu bezahlen.",
