1.01
- Added custom AI BlockScore for Kaiserdom to hopefully make the AI build it next to their city, without overwriting other important stuff. Not tested.
1.02
- Fixed typo
- Made savegame compatible and now using a safe GUID range (that wont conflict with the game ever)
- This also means a one time savegame compatibilty break! Don't update if you already built the Kaiserdom in your savegame!
1.03
Added it to 2 more public effectlists.
1.04
Added it to culture effect list, so attractivity can be effected.
1.05
Update for game version 16.1 (eg. new buildmenu)
1.06:
- unlock in creativemode. Included Stamp, copy it to your Documents/Anno 1800/stamps folder into the correct session folder.
1.07:
- updated graphics taken from Fishboss1 Old Town Mod: https://www.nexusmods.com/anno1800/mods/10
1.08:
outcommented some useless code that did nothing (the code that tried to make the AI also build the monuement, but I dont know how to do that properly)
1.09
- forbid AI to build it, just to be sure they dont screw up.
1.10:
- changed GUIType to "Generic" for the finished Kaiserdom, this way the description is shown on down right UI.
1.11:
- added BuildPermit system, so you can only build it once and a second time after you unlocked the last stage (5k investors).
- removed the worldfair events from it
- doubled the publicservice range
