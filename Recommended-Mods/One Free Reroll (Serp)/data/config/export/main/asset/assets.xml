  <!-- set TraderItemRerollCosts for all 3rd party traders defined here to 0 (we define them manually to not mess up eg. with scenario merchants) -->
  <!-- unfortunately "TraderRerollInterval" does not only affect the automatic change of offered itesm, but also when the trader offers new goods after reaching a new progression. So we can not set it to 10 hours or so. -->
  <!-- instead we will reduce ItemBuyLimitRestoreDuration from 30 minutes to 10 minutes and increase TraderRerollInterval from 5 minutes to 10 minutes. -->
  <!-- this way (at new games) the timer shown at the items page will also show the time when the items are automatically changed, so you know if it is worth to drive to the merchant, you have to hurry or if it is too late already, because it will switch soon. -->
