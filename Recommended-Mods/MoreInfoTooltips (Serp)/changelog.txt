1.001:
- Improve the formatting for the current money value in buildcost tooltip, so big amounts are rounded.
- Add the available amounts also to UpgradeCosts
1.002:
- Add keybind to toggle the infotip when hovering over ship objects in the world off/on (Shift+I).
- Show the Cargo of ships when hovering over them also for allied or spied (sabotage mod) players.
- Show the buff description from socketed items only for foreign ships (never for own ships) if you spied on them (sabotage mod).
- Unify the display list of cargo/sockets to always show them below eachother with text, like the vanilla Expedition Tooltip from ships does.
- If the hovered ship is neither your own, nor from an ally, nor from a spied one, then only display the default stats of this shiptype, not the real ones (so no buffs are considered)
1.003:
- reduced amount of SustainObjective_ShowStatsSerp to reduce lag when toggling the ship stats on huge savegames.
