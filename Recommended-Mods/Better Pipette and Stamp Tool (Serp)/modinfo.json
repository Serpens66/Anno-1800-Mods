    "Chinese": "Increases the max rectangle of selection. Allows to copy and stamp buildings that are not yet unlocked (eg. when you placed not-unocked blueprints via stamp). You still can not place locked copied single blueprints (with pipette), but you can place them when you copied more than one thing.",

    "German": "Vergrößert das maximale Auswahlrechteck. Erlaubt es Gebäude die noch nicht unlocked sind mit Pipette zu kopieren oder einen Stempel zu erstellen (zb. wenn sie durch einen Stempel platziert wurden). Man kann einzelne locked Gebäude mit der Pipette leider immernoch nicht platzieren, aber sobald es mehr als eines sind, gehts.",
