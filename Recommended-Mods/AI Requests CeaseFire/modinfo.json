  "Description": {
    "Chinese": "If you destroyed ships/buildings of AI, there is a 20% chance for some AIs to request CeaseFire. This mod enables this for all AIs and removes the required min-reputation for requesting Ceasefire and reduces the min reputation for requesting peace from 30 to 3. Depending on AI difficulty the vanilla game also checks for military strength. \n This mod is already integrated into my EveryoneHardAI mod. \n Use also my -Free CeaseFire- Mod if you dont want them to demand money in that case.",

    "German": "Zerstört man Schiffe/Gebäude der KI, gibt es eine 20% Chance, dass manche KIs dann Waffenstillstand erbitten. Dieser Mod aktiviert dies für alle KIs und entfernt den MindestRuf für Waffenstillstand und setzt ihn für Frieden von 30 auf 3 herunter. \n Dieser Mod ist in meinem Mod EveryOneHardAI bereits integriert. \n Nutze dazu meinen -Free CeaseFire- Mod wenn sie in diesem Fall kein Geld für ihre Bitte verlangen sollen.",
