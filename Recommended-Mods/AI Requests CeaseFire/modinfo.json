  "Description": {
    "Chinese": "如果你摧毁了AI的船只/建筑物，某些AI有20%的机会要求停火。此Mod为所有 AI 启用此功能，并删除请求停火所需的最低声誉，并将请求和平的最低声誉从 30 降低到 3。根据AI难度，默认游戏还会检查军事实力。\n 这个模组已经集成到 -EveryoneHard AI- Mod中。",
    "English": "If you destroyed ships/buildings of AI, there is a 20% chance for some AIs to request CeaseFire. This mod enables this for all AIs and removes the required min-reputation for requesting Ceasefire and reduces the min reputation for requesting peace from 30 to 3. Depending on AI difficulty the vanilla game also checks for military strength. \n This mod is already integrated into my EveryoneHardAI mod. \n Use also my -Free CeaseFire- Mod if you dont want them to demand money in that case.",

    "German": "Zerstört man Schiffe/Gebäude der KI, gibt es eine 20% Chance, dass manche KIs dann Waffenstillstand erbitten. Dieser Mod aktiviert dies für alle KIs und entfernt den MindestRuf für Waffenstillstand und setzt ihn für Frieden von 30 auf 3 herunter. \n Dieser Mod ist in meinem Mod EveryOneHardAI bereits integriert. \n Nutze dazu meinen -Free CeaseFire- Mod wenn sie in diesem Fall kein Geld für ihre Bitte verlangen sollen.",
