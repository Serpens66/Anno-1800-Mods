    "German": "Verdoppelt die Ladegeschwindigkeit von Anlegestellen (sind jetzt so schnell wie Kontorstufe 3) und erhöht die Ladegeschwindeigkeit von verbesserten Piers von 4 auf 6, womit sie ein wenig schneller als Kontorstufe 4 sind. Wartungskosten für die verbesserten Anlegestellen sind in jeder Region gleich und betragen 500, anstelle von 1500 (bzw. 50 artkis, was vermutlich ein bug ist). Für normale Anlegestellen Wartungskosten 100 statt 50.",
