  "Description": {
    "Chinese": "将所有商品的基本价格调整为-每个产品的生产链维护成本-除以0.8。这样你就可以在商人那里以+-0的价格出售你的过剩产品，但仍然会损失空间/劳动力和一次性建筑成本。大多数商品会变得更贵与这个mod，除了许多终局和北极商品，他们变得更便宜。\n建造船只需要花费一些钱，你可以以平均1.5倍于总建造成本的价格出售它们(包括基本价格的材料)",
    "English": "- Adjusts all Baseprices of all (vanilla) Goods to -Maintenance costs of the production chain per product- divided by 0.8. This way you can sell your overproduction at +-0 at merchants, but still have the loss of space/workforce and one time building costs. Most goods will get more expensive with this mod, except many endgame and arctic goods, they get cheaper. \n- (vanilla) Ships cost a bit money to build, and you can sell them for average 1.5 times the total building costs (inculding materials at baseprice)",
    "French": "- Adjusts all Baseprices of all (vanilla) Goods to -Maintenance costs of the production chain per product- divided by 0.8.

    "German": "- Passt alle Basispreise von allen (vanilla) Waren an auf -Wartungskosten der herstellenden Gebäude- geteilt durch 0.8. Auf diese Weise kann man eine Überproduktion zu +-0 Bilanz verkaufen, hat aber dennoch den Verlust von Arbeitskraft und Platz. Die meisten Dinge werden durch diesen Mod teurer, abgesehen von Endgame und den meisten Arktis Produkten, diese werden oft günstiger. \n- (vanilla) Schiffe zu bauen kostet nun auch ein wenig Geld. Die Verkaufspreise der Schiffe wurden an die Produktionskosten angeglichen, sodass man beim Verkauf *1.5 dieser Kosten bekommt (die neuen Basispreise der Baumaterialien inbegriffen).",
