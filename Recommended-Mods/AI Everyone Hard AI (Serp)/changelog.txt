1.01:
- Added a little bit of variation for the Settle2ndIslandDelay value, since they all settled their 2nd island at exactly the same time.
- Also more variation for buying shares, so they dont buy at the same time.
1.02:
fixed more variation for 2nd island (not crucial, in 1.01 was just default time for smith and mercier, I fixed it to have individual time)
1.03:
Updated to Game Version 16.1
1.04:
- Raised required money amount for gifts and other diplomatic interactions for everyone to a similar level like Vicente Silva (success chance not changed).
- doubled the MaxShipCount of non-Airships for everyone.
- set the chance to take over an island after buying all shares or by military to 95% for all AIs (increased for easy/medium and slightly decreased for hard).
- every AI will place Seamines around harbor
1.05:
- code adjustments and minor fixes
1.06:
- increased ship cost and time multiplier from AI from 0.4 to 0.5 (vanilla 0.6).
1.07:
- minor code adjustments
- decreased warfleet ShipLimits from *2 to *1.5 of vanilla, because the CatchUpFactor of 110% of hard AI already makes sure it builds more ships in case the player has more than the ShipLimits.
1.08:
- Made Requesting CeaseFire and Peace the same for all AIs. 
  Now they request ceasefire with 20% chance everytime you destroy a building/ship on any reputation and if players militarystrength is at least 1.75 times higher.
  They request peace on the same situation with 20% if at least at 3 reputation and if player has at least 2.5 times more militarystrength
1.09:
- reduced the required multiplier of militarystrength for AI to request ceasefire if you destroy ship/building from *1.75 to *1.33 and for peace from *2.5 to *2 , so they request ceasefire/peace earlier.  
1.10:
- renamed folder and modname (ModID unchanged)
- Adjusted difficulty-points for the gamesettings, every AI gives +20points
1.11:
- added incompatibility error message to modinfo if Combat Overhal AI part is also active.
- only allow to request CeaseFire once per hour, even if successful (so with shorter CeaseFire mod you have to fight at least 45 minutes or get peace)
1.12:
- added incompatibility error message to modinfo if "MM All Characters 3 Stars" is also active.
- improved compatibility to other mods even more (mods adding new sessions and define a ShipLimits percentage for the AI in that session)
1.13:
- increased cooldown to the AIs positive AirshipDrop-Reactions to 15 minutes (from 30 seconds) (in vanilla you get +5 Reputation every single time you do a small positive Drop with an airship over an AI island. You can repeat it with a few Drop-objects over and over again every 30 seconds, which is simply OP).
- and reduced the rep gain from these drops from +5 to +3 fo care packagages and +2 for water drops.
1.14:
- -15 Rep when damaging AI with airship bombs
