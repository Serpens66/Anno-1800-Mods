1.01:
- added: All AI asks for permission to settle an island. Changed rep bonus/malus for accept/decline of this. 
 I added this to this mod instead making a new one, because AI can only ask for permission in sessions the human already unlocked.
 1.02:
- improved code by using the game intern "MayEnterSessionsBeforeHuman" value from the AIs, instead of adding new SecondPartyReferenceUnlock to the sessions itself.
