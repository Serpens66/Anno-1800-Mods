  "Description": {
    "Chinese": "将生命值从 9000 增加到 （26k，28k，29k，30k），道德力量从 200 增加到 350。\n此外，更高等级的康托尔将造成更高的伤害（125/150/175/200）。\n这样，当它受到攻击时，也会花费更长的时间来降低这个岛屿的士气。\n因此，您有更多时间移动船只来保卫岛屿。",
    "English": "Increases the hitpoints of a kontor from 9000 to (26k,28k,29k,30k) and the MoralPower from 200 to 350. \nIn addition higher tier kontors will do higher damage (125/150/175/200). \nThis way it will also take longer to decrease the moral of this island, when it is attacked. \nSo you have more time to move your ships to defend the island.",
