1.01:
- Fixed a bug in code which caused no pirate ships in Earlygame if also my Stronger Pirates mod was active.
- Made the cheat item that makes pirate ships stronger, not researchable.
1.02:
- Reduced the comback fleet a bit more, if stronger pirates are enabled (previuosly it was ~50%, now it is ~40% of stronger pirates mod)
- increased chance for pirate ships to drop the default loot.
1.03:
- code improvement (faster loading)
- also reduced pirate trigger ship spawning in new world (forgot it) if stronger pirate mod is enabled
1.04:
- Using a "Buff" now instead of an Item for making pirate ships stronger. This way also pirate ships from mods are affected as long as they belong to the pirate.
- The pirate combeackfleet in vanilla does not belong to the pirate (yes), therefore in this case ships added by other mods than mine wont be buffed in comebackfleet.
- renamed mod to "Buffed Pirate Ships" instead of "Stronger Pirate Ships", but ModID remains the same.
1.05:
- made compatible to my mod "Buffed GeneralEnemy Ships"
1.06:
- Make sure even if my "Stronger Pirates" mod is active, the SelfHealing is still only +200% of vanilla and not more.
- changed Buff Icon
1.07:
- set ShouldBeShownInForeignObjectMenu=0 by default now. Use my mod "DisplayBuffsFromOthers" if you want it to show
1.08:
- made sure my mod "DisplayBuffsFromOthers" can display the buffs from this mod from other players.
