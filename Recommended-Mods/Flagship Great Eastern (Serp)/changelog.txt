1.01:
- kind of fixed the turret direction. at least the bug does not appear with a TurnSpawn of 182 and less, so this is the turnspan now.
- Added code to get a new normal Great Eastern via Quest offered when you have none anymore. 
- allow the AI to build ship to have one at a time.
1.02:
- fixed ship name string for tradescreen and some others (showed "AssetData..." before, this is not supported by the game on many locations unofrtunately)
