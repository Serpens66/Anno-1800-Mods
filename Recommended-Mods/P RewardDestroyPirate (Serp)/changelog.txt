1.01:
- reduced loading time of the mod from ~6 seconds to 0.1 seconds (by using "//" in Path as seldom as possible)
1.02:
- now you get the reward only after all pirate buildings are destroyed, instead of when the harbour is destroyed.
- only players that destroy at least 2 towers or the harbor building (last shot), will get the rewards in multiplayer (or at least 2 pirate ship from comeback fleet)
- code adjustments
- Pirates also react on destroy of other pirate
1.03:
- classified the background quest difficulty "Medium" which mostly means 2 times the money reward.
- if my stronger pirates mod is active, the money reward is increased to *3 (Hard)
- fixed: LaFortunes Harbor destroy rewards was only triggered once and not again on next destroy
- the money reward is now tied to the progresslevel when defeating the pirate, not when the game started/the last time he resettled.
- code improvements
