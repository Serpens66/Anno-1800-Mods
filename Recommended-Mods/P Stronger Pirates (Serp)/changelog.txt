1.01:
- Made earlier Fregatte unlock savegame compatible.
1.02:
- made sure everything is compatible to game version 16.1
- Added flamethrower Monitor to Late (1) and Endgame (6) pirate Fleet
- slightly increased the combackfleet in Late and Endgame
1.03:
- comeback fleet in Late und Endgame now consists of ship of the line and monitor, instead of only one type.
- made counterproposals 3 times more expensive (eg. when you request ceasefire but the pirate does not like you enough to accept it for free). This may be adjusted in case ubisoft fixes the bug: that this cost do not scale with progress.
1.04:
- code adjustments and bugfix of 1.03 (counterproposal cost change most likely did not work in 1.03)
1.05:
- Added battlecrusier to the normal pirate fleet (1 in late und 3 in endgame).
- Increased amount of flamethrowers ships from pirates in Lategame from 1 to 3. 
- Increased archibald and sarmentos harbor range, so pirate avoids a bigger radius around them to not be targetet by the guns that often.
- Halfed the CraftingTime of the pirates ships, so they spawn them faster and doubled their selfheal when out of combat (still very slow).
- increased quest time limit to defeat comeback-fleet from 10 to 15 minutes (vanilla 30 minutes)
- If not in war with pirates, they have a 50% chance to ask every 30 minutes for money, if they are stronger than you. If not paid they will cancel treaties or even declare war, even if they liked you.
- If not in war and the pirates don't like you (anymore), they will only declare/threat war if they are at least half as strong as you (unless the reputation is below 1, then the strength does not matter)
1.06:
- Fixed LaFortune Resettle (maybe he previously spawned Harlow ships in old world.. my code was wrong)
- The whole resettle group will now spawn at the same location (ships added by this mod previously spawned random).
- You are offered CaeseFire with both pirates at gamestart and treaty is war also with LaFortune. This way you can safely settle your first island and have an exact timer when war will start with the pirates.
- Pirate ships will now also attack/hunt your warships when you come too close. This was added to make sure they don't simply ignore warships shooting on them. Unfortunately there is no way to make them act perfectly right, so downside may mean they will also attack if your ship is stronger. (because wen can only convert this "ignore ships of specific strenght" to attack or to flee)
- Pirates will spawn a ship of each kind (once every 20 minutes one ship, up to 2 ships of each kind), to make sure in the later progressions pirates have some diversity of ships.
- Increased Comeback timer from 1 hour to 2 hours again (vanilla 2.5 hours) so it is more rewarding to defeat them.
- increased Island-repair timer from 5 minutes to 10 minutes (vanilla 25 minutes) to allow a fast second attack if the first fails.
1.07:
- bugfix in the code to spawn a pirate ship every 20 minute (was not active in 1.06 therefore).
- Added few flamethrower ship and battlecruiser to comebackfleet of Late and Endgame.
1.08:
- increased MilitaryDefensePoints for pirate harbor and turrets, so the AI knows they are stronger. This also increases the pirates militarystrenght.
- Made the regular money request from pirates if you are in peace or higher more expensive (min 50k). CounterProposal of pirate is still vanilla cheap.
1.09:
- Nerf SelfHeal from pirate harbor, vanilla is 300, while the highest selfheal from other things is 10! Set it 50.
- code improvements
- add flak monitor to endgame warfleet
- removed "shorter CeaseFire+NonAttack"-code, use the standalone mod with that name instead.
- you can only request CeaseFire once per hour from pirate (together with "shorter ceasefire-mod" this means you have to fight at least 15 minutes or make peace) 
1.10:
- updated shared mod PirateDefeatHelpers and fixed the LaFortune Trigger to spawn some ships not working.
- more money rewards in my "rewards destroy pirates mod" if you also use it
1.11:
- added flak on top of pirate harbour buildings, thanks Ac3s for permission to use his code.
