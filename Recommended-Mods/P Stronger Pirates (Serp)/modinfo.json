    "Chinese": "海盗塔+~30%的伤害和+50%的生命值。\n海盗大炮的生命值和伤害加倍。\n海盗港有3万生命值，这与岛屿的道德更相关。\n海盗在每个阶段会多出5艘船，并且会有更多的高级船。船在一半的时间内建成，如果你在附近，也会攻击你的战舰。\n他们会每120分钟(而不是150分钟)带着相当大的舰队回来(游戏中后期有10艘战列舰)，并且会在战斗后10分钟修复基地。\n只要20分钟，而不是30分钟，击败海盗舰队，然后他们再次定居。\n停火将只持续45分钟，而不是180分钟(也是第二方)\n非攻击协议持续90分钟，而不是4小时。(也适用于第2方)\n像炮艇一样在造船厂同时解锁护卫舰，这样你在游戏前期和中期对抗海盗的机会就会大一些。海盗还将建造战列巡洋舰和火焰喷射器监视器。你将开始与两个海盗的战争，但会得到一个免费的停火协议，所以你仍然可以解决你的第一个岛屿，即使是强硬的海盗。与海盗保持和平或更高级的关系需要付出更多的代价，因为如果你不比他们强大多少，他们就会向你索要赎金，要求你不要定期取消条约。\n既不添加新船也不给海盗船任何疯狂的buff。",

    "German": "Basis:\n- Piraten Türme machen ~30% mehr Schaden und haben 50% mehr Lebenspunkte.\n- Die Piraten Big Berta hat doppelte Lebenspunkte und Schaden.\n- Der Priatenhafen hat 30k Lebenspunkte und ist bzgl. Moral der Insel relevanter.\n- Gebäude reparieren sich 10 Minuten nach Ende des Kriegszustandes (also ~20 Minuten nach letztem Schuss), sofern Pirat nicht komplett besiegt wurde.\nSchiffe:\n- Piraten haben ~5 Schiffe mehr in ihrer Kriegsflotte und außerdem mehr hochstufige Schiffe, sie werden doppelt so schnell gebaut und greifen häufiger auch Kriegsschiffe in der Nähe an.\n- Nachdem Piraten besiegt wurden, kommen sie schon nach 120 (Statt 150) Minuten zurück mit einer deutlich größeren Flotte (10 Linienschiffe zum Zeitpunkt von Ingenieuren).\n- Die Quest die Piratenflotte vor dem Wiederaufbau zu besiegen, hat nur noch ein Zeitlimit von 20, anstelle von 30 Minuten.\nSonstiges:\n- Waffenstillstand dauert nur noch 45 Minuten anstatt 2 Stunden, dies gilt auch für KI Mitspieler.\n- Nichtangriffs-Pakt dauert nur noch 90 Minuten anstatt 4 Stunden, dies gilt auch für KI Mitspieler.\n- Alle Spieler können die Fregatte schon mit Arbeitern bauen, damit man anfangs etwas mehr Feuerkraft gegen die stärkeren Piraten hat. Piraten bauen nun auch Schlachtkreuzer und Flammenwerfer Monitor. Man startet im Krieg mit beiden Piraten, bekommt aber ein Angebot für kostenlosen Waffenstillstand, sodass man die erste Insel in Ruhe besiedeln kann. Frieden oder mehr mit den Piraten zu halten wird teurer, da dieser nun immer mal wieder Geld für die Aufrechterhaltung der Verträge verlangt, sofern man militärisch nicht deutlich überlegen ist. \nDer Mod fügt weder neuen Schiffe hinzu, noch gibt er den Piratenschiffen irgendendwelche verrückten Boni.",
