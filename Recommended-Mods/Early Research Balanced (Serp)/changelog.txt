1.01
Removed cheatcode which was there for testing (instant and free researchcenter monument and easy africa/kap unlock)
1.02
Made random researchpoints-quest-reward working. So instead all providing flat 50, they will give amounts between 20 and up to 4500 in Endgame.
1.03
- Increased the donation reward for items by factor 1.5 to 3
- Made the college building ~30% cheaper.
1.04
- Provide some free researchpoints on artista and tourism populations levels
- add building to the new maintenance assets list
1.05
- Make move clay/move oil/researchkit cost increase only by 1000 instead of 1500 and have max costs of 25k instead of 250k.
- As soon as the original Research Center Monument is finished, you won't be able to build the mod research center anymore. (previously you could do this and keep to continue using workers and without elictricity)
1.06
- Maintenance money costs reduced from 250 to 100. 
1.07:
- add unlock for creative mode
1.08:
- reduced first-time costs for Godlikes like change mine/fertility and so on from 5000 to 4500 so you can afford it a single time with the early research system.
- if my Spy/Sabotage mod is active, the Spy will also cost a small amount of researchpoints to build
- removed balance changes that are not necessary for the mod to work fine (eg. AbsoluteLimit of item researchcosts and researchtimes), to be more compatible with mods changing researchscosts.
- using conditions where possible to not overwrite lower costs values already set by cheat mods.
- item research costs will be vanilla (or other mods) costs now after a fixed amount of items researched cheaper.
- slightly increased the amount of researchpoints you get when donating items (increased from previous mod version) and also compatible to mods that already increased that value.
