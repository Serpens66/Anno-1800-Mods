  "KnownIssues": {
    "Chinese": "Possibly Flickering after a certain time (although did not happen on my side yet and should be much more seldom than map mods with more than 1 continental island). At best only use one map mod at once and no other mod-session with more contiinetnal islands.",

    "German": "Könnte sein, dass die Graphik nach einiger Zeit und mehreren Sessions anfängt zu flackern. Wobei dies angeblich nur bei Map Mods passiert, die mehr als eine Kontinental Insel haben, daher hoffe ich, dass das hier nicht passiert (mir noch nicht passiert). Am Besten nur diesen einen Map Mod und keine Mod-Sessions mit weiteren Kontinental Inseln installieren.",
