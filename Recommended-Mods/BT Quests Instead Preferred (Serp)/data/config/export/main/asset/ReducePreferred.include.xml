  <!-- change preferredgoods, so they are still displayed and my preferred and balance mods used, but they are not really exploitable with that prices anymore, as long as there is no quest from this mod active  -->
    <!-- dont balance it here, but load my Balanced Profits mod before to have balanced values -->
  <!-- With quests regarding preferred goods we will multiply the money you get with 2.5  -->
  <!-- (explanation: low values, eg *2 means that the PriceMultiplier for preferedd-other-session goods must be quite high, eg. 1.5 or more, to get decent profit, but this would mean their price would also be quite high without such a quest, so quest multiply of *2 is not enough -->
    <!-- a hihger value like *3 from quests would mean you get this tripple value also for preferrred same session goods, because of course we can not set PriceMultiplier below 1 for them (otherwise they would yield less money than normal goods), so 3 times for preferred of same session is slightly too much. Therefore I chose *2.5 for the session) -->
   <!-- for vanilla things with PriceMultiplier=4, in a way that we in the end still have *4, this means the PriceMultiplier should be reduced to: ~1.6. -->
   <!-- For balanced things I set PriceMultiplier=2, we use a PriceMultiplier of 1.05, to still have them a little bit better than non-preferred, which leads to *2.625 more than normal goods. -->
   <!-- and all other values will be set sth in between -->
  <!-- kleiner als 2.25 -->
