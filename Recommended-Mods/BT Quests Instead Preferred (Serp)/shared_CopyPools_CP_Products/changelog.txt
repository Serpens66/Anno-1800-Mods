1.002:
- add Mod Regions (Asia)
- improve code by no longer relying on Pools, but using Product/AssociatedRegion to find products produced in the region
1.0022:
- fix error in the new code
1.023:
- add AllowNoMatch to the Mod-region products-modops, so they do not print a warning in log if no mod region exists
1.024:
- Switch from AssociatedRegion to ProductionRegions, because we want the region where it is produced.
- switch from AllowNoMatch for the Mod-Regions to using a Condition, because AllowNoMatch did not prevent the warning in the log
