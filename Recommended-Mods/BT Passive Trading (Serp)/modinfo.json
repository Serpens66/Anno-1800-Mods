  "Description": {
    "Chinese": "增加AI商人和对手的被动贸易预算（15k到300k），但减少贸易舰队，每艘商船的容量为40吨，以弥补高预算。这样，您还可以从被动交易者那里购买/出售高价值商品（如果有库存），但最多只能购买 40 吨 （8*5） 的所有商品。这种金额减少还可以防止商家从AI玩家那里购买所有商品，拒绝您从AI玩家那里获得折扣。我推荐我的模组 |无AI商户交易|来解决这个问题和我的其他平衡交易模组",
    "English": "Increases the passive Trade budget from merchants and opponents: EarlyGame 15k to Endgame 300k (instead of vanilla 3k to 10k for AI and 2k to 4k for merchants), but reduces TradeFleet (only for merchants not for AI) and every merchant ship has capacity of 105t to compensate for high budget and slightly faster loadingtime. This way you will be able to also buy/sell high valued goods from passive traders (if they have it in stock), but only always only up to 105t (15*7) of everything at max. The merchants will only trade an amount of 25t with AIs, to make sure there is still some left for you at AIs kontor.",

Außerdem haben alle Schiffe eine maximale Kapazität von 105 Tonnen (15*7) und leicht schnellere Verladezeit.\nAuf diese Weise können durch das höhere Budget auch teurere Waren gehandelt werden. Mit der KI handeln die neutralen Händler nur 25t aufeinmal, um sicherzustellen, dass von den ganzen guten Angeboten für den Spieler noch was über bleibt.",

  "KnownIssues": [
    {
      "English": "To make sure the trade amount is different for AI cmopared to human, the ship is shortly replaced with another ship with different stacklimit when it trades with humans. This leads to short strange visual when the ship is replaced.",
      "German": "Um sicherzustellen, dass die Handelsmenge für KI geringer ist als für Menschen, wird das Schiff kurzzeitig durch ein anderes mit höherem Stacklimit ersetzt, wenn es nah an einem menschlichem Kontor ist. Dieses ausstauschen sieht ein wenig komisch aus."
