1.01 
- forked from More Passive Trade Budget to include TradeFleet reduction and 40t capacity for merchant ships to compensate for higher budget.
1.02:
- Using save GUID range. This also means a one time savegame compatibilty break! Don't update if you already used this mod in your savegame!
1.03:
- Ai Merchants will change ships depending on game progress, since I found a way to remove the old ships (so they will no longer sum up to too many ships, so we can use more different ships, although they only differ in speed)
1.04:
- Update game version 16.1 and finally the TradeBudget will increase over time from 5k to 100k.
1.05:
- Increased Trade Budget even more, 100k in the latest Lategame is not enough.
1.06:
- Code improvements and also Budget increase for Old Nate (missed him in updte 1.05).
1.07:
- renaming of modname and folder (ModID stays the same)
- making the mod also work fine when loaded into existing savegame (removing the vanilla tradeships of merchants)
- gave some ships of traders a bit different speed, so they hopefully do not arrive all the same time at the same island.
1.08:
- the mod will now shortly replace the merchant ship with one with higher stacklimit while the merchant ship is close to a humans kontor. This way the merchants will trade more with humans than with AI, which makes sure the AI will have offers left for humans to trade.
- trading amounts with humans will be 105t, while with AI it will be 25t.
-  this feature is done by changing the ship shortly with another one when the merchant ship is near a human harbor (radius 115), the change looks a bit strange for half a second.
- Eli will use a ship one level below the others and kahina gets a minor speed buff, to make sure they dont arrive same island the same time too often.
- also Ketema and Sarmento use 2 different ship levels now, to make sure they dont arrive same time same island.
- after updating the mod some merchant ships might be missing, but will shortly after spawn again.
- compatible to my mod Attainments by Honor, which lets you increase the amounts from 25t to 50/105/200t by spending honor.
- compatible to my Nates in Old World mod
