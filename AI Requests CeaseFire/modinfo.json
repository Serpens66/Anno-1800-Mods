  "Description": {
    "Chinese": "如果你摧毁了AI的船只/建筑，一些AI有20%的机会请求停火。该mod为所有AI启用了这一功能，并删除了请求停火所需的最低信誉，并将请求和平的最低信誉从30降低到3。根据AI的难度，香草游戏也会检查军事实力。\n这个mod已经集成到我的[EveryoneHard AI]mod中。\n如果你不想让他们在这种情况下要钱，也可以使用我的免费[CeaseFire]Mod。",
    "English": "If you destroyed ships/buildings of AI, there is a 20% chance for some AIs to request CeaseFire. This mod enables this for all AIs and removes the required min-reputation for requesting Ceasefire and reduces the min reputation for requesting peace from 30 to 3. Depending on AI difficulty the vanilla game also checks for military strength. \n This mod is already integrated into my EveryoneHardAI mod. \n Use also my -Free CeaseFire- Mod if you dont want them to demand money in that case.",

    "German": "Zerstört man Schiffe/Gebäude der KI, gibt es eine 20% Chance, dass manche KIs dann Waffenstillstand erbitten. Dieser Mod aktiviert dies für alle KIs und entfernt den MindestRuf für Waffenstillstand und setzt ihn für Frieden von 30 auf 3 herunter. \n Dieser Mod ist in meinem Mod EveryOneHardAI bereits integriert. \n Nutze dazu meinen -Free CeaseFire- Mod wenn sie in diesem Fall kein Geld für ihre Bitte verlangen sollen.",
