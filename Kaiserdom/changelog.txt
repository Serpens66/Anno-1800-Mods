1.01
- Added custom AI BlockScore for Kaiserdom to hopefully make the AI build it next to their city, without overwriting other important stuff. Not tested.
1.02
- Fixed typo
- Made savegame compatible and now using a safe GUID range (that wont conflict with the game ever)
- This also means a one time savegame compatibilty break! Don't update if you already built the Kaiserdom in your savegame!
1.03
Added it to 2 more public effectlists.
1.04
Added it to culture effect list, so attractivity can be effected.
1.05
Update for game version 16.1 (eg. new buildmenu)
1.06:
- unlock in creativemode. Included Stamp, copy it to your Documents/Anno 1800/stamps folder into the correct session folder.
