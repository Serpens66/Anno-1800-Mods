1.01:
- added code to unload the session if it is already loaded on enter.
1.02:
- changed the trigger that unloads the session to only fire while the mod is active (triggers are saved to savegame and can also trigger while mod is not active anymore).
  This way the session will no longer be unloaded when you disable the mod.
