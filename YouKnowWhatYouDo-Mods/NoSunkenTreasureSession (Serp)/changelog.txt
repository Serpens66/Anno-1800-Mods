1.01:
- added code to unload the session if it is already loaded on enter.
1.02:
- changed the trigger that unloads the session to only fire while the mod is active (triggers are saved to savegame and can also trigger while mod is not active anymore).
  This way the session will no longer be unloaded when you disable the mod.
1.03:
- made sure the Expedition to Cape can start if you had this mod active, but disabled it. Only works for new games started with version 1.03 or higher. If you started with a lower version and want the expedition to work, disable the mod and use the console command "ts.Conditions.RegisterTriggerForCurrentParticipant(113818)".
