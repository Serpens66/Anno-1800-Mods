    <!-- disabled options are: -->
    <!-- OptionalQuestRewards - multiply the wuestrewads by 1 - 0.25. also multiplies items, so does not make much sense -->
    <!-- OptionalQuestTimeout -  all settings have a timefactor value of 1, so guess makes no sense to only enable it. but I also don't know what it means. -->
    <!-- DistributionWorkforce - Hafenarbeiter . no clue what this does. description says sth about dock workers in my kontor-->
    <!-- HostileTakeover - feindliche Ãœbernahme  seems to work, at least I can no longer buy island shares. -->
