  "Description": {
    "Chinese": "Increases the passive Trade budget from merchants and opponents: EarlyGame 15k to Endgame 300k (instead of vanilla 3k to 10k for AI and 2k to 4k for merchants). Attention: This will also mean the Merchants will fullfill all needs of the AI, so you will only seldom be able to trade at the AI harbors. Use my -BT More Passive Trading- mod instead for a amount limitation instead.",

    "German": "Erhöht das passive Handelsbudget von den Händlern und KI Mitspielern: EarlyGame 15k bis EndGame 300k (anstatt von vanilla 3k bis 10k für KI und 2k bis 4k für Händler). Achtung: Das heißt die Händler werden alle Warenbedürfnisse der KI erfüllen, wodurch man als Spieler nur noch sehr selten am Kontor der KI handeln kann. Nutze stattdessen meinen -BT More Passive Trading- Mod um auch die Handelsmenge zu limitieren.",
