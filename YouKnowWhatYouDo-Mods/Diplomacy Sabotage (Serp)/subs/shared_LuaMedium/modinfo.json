  "KnownIssues": [
    {
      "English": "Ingame Mods Reloading with mods.reload() may often crash the game and leave corrupted savegames, which may crash the game before reaching the startmenu... did not find out what exactly is causing it, most likely events, although lua does not start before a game is loaded... Delete recent savegame and remove mods to reach main menu and delete the savegame ingame (because of stupid cloudsave they come back)"
