    "1.001" : "Add ModioResourceId and changelog to modinfo.json\nFix the bug that -change owner- did not work. Now gifting ships, selling/buying ships and getting control of support fleet should work like intended.",
    "1.002" : "Fix the bug that you were no longer able to buy a new flagship from neutral traders (my new code prevented it because flagship in general is not sellable, but in this case its intended to allow the buy..)",
    "1.01" : "Add English translation (thx LokiCharms).\n- Add my new mod -MoreInfoTooltipsNew_Serp-. In a future update you will be able to see cargo of ships from spied players (and now already from allied players).\n- New saboatage action: Add bad newspaper article to next newspaper (only makes sense against other humans)\n- Add a 'Quest' which spawns a AI spy on your island if Rep is below 40. If you dont find and eliminate the spy within 10 minutes, sabotage will happen: bad news, steal money or bad reputation. So unlike the other AI spies you will have a Quest for this which shows you the island and the spy will not shoot at your buildings, but move around and only after the timelimit the sabotage will happen.\n- several bugfixes:\n- - Fix explosion doing no damage\n- - Fix Easy setting to also properly reduce crafting time/costs in spy post building\n- - using UniqueType for the barracks (Kaserne) building now, instead of my previous unfortunately unreliable code. Once per island.\n- - Making the Participants Mercier and Pirates infectable by Incidents"
