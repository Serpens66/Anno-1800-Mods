1.01:
- improved the code and removed the most complicated workarounds because I found much simpler solutions (no more spawn whole warlfeet by trigger isntead and no more restore of relation)
1.02:
- removed LoadAfterIDs in modinfo, because load order does not matter anymore.
1.03:
- fixed some things not working for LaFortune
- fixed missing modop close in Declarewar xml
1.04:
- improved code a bit
- added trigger to make all ships from pirates again roaming around every 30 minutes after they are not moving anymore (happens for ships not in official warfleet, eg. comebackfleet)
- fixed just another rare vanilla bug (warfleet not spawning at all anymore)
