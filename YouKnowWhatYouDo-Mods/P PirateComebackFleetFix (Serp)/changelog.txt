1.01:
- improved the code and removed the most complicated workarounds because I found much simpler solutions (no more spawn whole warlfeet by trigger isntead and no more restore of relation)
1.02:
- removed LoadAfterIDs in modinfo, because load order does not matter anymore.
1.03:
- fixed some things not working for LaFortune
- fixed missing modop close in Declarewar xml
1.04:
- improved code a bit
- added trigger to make all ships from pirates again roaming around every 30 minutes after they are not moving anymore (happens for ships not in official warfleet, eg. comebackfleet)
- fixed just another rare vanilla bug (warfleet not spawning at all anymore)
1.05:
- instead of trying to get the warfleet that changed to neutral on harbor destroy back (which only works halfway), we will make the harbor invincible. Destroy all canons of the pirates to defeat him.
- removed the 30minutes trigger from 1.04 again, because although it makes all standing-still ships from comebackfleet move again, it still can disrupt an ongoing pirate attack. So we will live with the bug that comebackfleet will not roaming around, just attack/defend.
1.06:
- added military_attention_pirates to LoadAfterIDs.
- added MP_LaFortune_Peace_Serp as submod (bugfix)
- fixed big bertha which had DefaultBuff at different code location.
- removed exception for combat overhaul for removing comebackfleet step by step, because this is also important for bugfix.
