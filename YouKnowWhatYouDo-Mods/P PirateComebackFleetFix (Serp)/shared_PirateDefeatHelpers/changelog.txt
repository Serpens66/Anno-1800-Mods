1.01:
- for whatever reason "ConditionIsParticipantInGame" does not work for LaFortune (anymore?), so triggers using this did not fire. Using another condition now and changed the GUID of the triggers using it to also update for savegames using an older version of this mod.

1.02:
- tranformed triggers into FeatureUnlocks. Do not add your actions to them anymore (will still "work", but do not), because triggers can not change in savegames. Instead use UnlockNeeded Condition with the piratedefeated-GUID to create your own trigger with your own actions.

1.03:
- moved the helper Quests to another position to make sure they are not accidently included in an AIs Questpool (was most likely in Merciers)
