1.01:
- added code to restore the amount of researchpoints you had before this mod identified all items. (does not restore it if you used version 1.0 of this mod unfortunately)
1.02:
- added check to be compatible if you already use cheat command "ToggleIgnoreBuildingCosts"
1.03:
- added submod to add a keybind Ctrl+Home to again identify all unidentified items, eg. when you added another mod adding more items.
- moved scripts inside a folder named by the mod, so they are not overwritten by other mods.
