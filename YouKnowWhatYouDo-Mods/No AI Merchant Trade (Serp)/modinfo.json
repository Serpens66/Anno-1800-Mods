    "English": "Removes the trade agreement between AI and neutral traders (2nd to 3rd party). This way they will no longer trade with neutral traders, which mostly means they will more trade with eachother and the human player if you have a trade-agreement. Recommended to use with my Balanced Trading Mods. If |BT Passive Trading| is active the capacitiy of neutral merchant ships is increased from 40 to 80, because it was only set that low, because they should not fullfill all trading needs of AI at once.",

    "German": "Entfernt den Handelsvertrag zwischen KI und neutralen Händlers (2nd zu 3rd party). Dadurch handelt die KI nicht mehr länger mit den neutralen Händlern, was in erster Linie bedeutet sie hat mehr zum Handeln mit anderen KIs und vorallem auch den menschlichen Spielern, wenn du einen Handelsvertrag mit ihnen hast. Empfohlen zusammen mit meinen Balanced Trading Mods. Wenn |BT Passive Trading| aktiv ist, wird von diesem auch die Kapazität der neutralen Händlerschiffe erhöht von 40 auf 80, da diese in erster Linie so klein gesetzt wurden, damit sie bei der KI nicht alles weghandeln.",
