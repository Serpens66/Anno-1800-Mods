# Anno 1800 Mods
Mods for Anno 1800 created by me (Serp/Serpens66).
You can open the modinfo.json file of each mod for an explanation what it does (should be displayed automatically when you use a modmanager).

The mods here in "YouKnowWhatYouDo-Mods"-folder are either mods that not everyone may want to have installed or even may be kind of breaking.
You should carefully read the modinfo description and think if you want mods fom here installed to your mod.

READ the modinfo description of each mod carefully to decide if you really want this mod to be active!
These are not mods you simply install all together to improve the game, you should know what you are doing!
