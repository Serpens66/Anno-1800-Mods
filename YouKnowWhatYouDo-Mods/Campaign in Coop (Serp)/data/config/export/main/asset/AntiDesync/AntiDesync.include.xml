<!-- MovieFinished, NotificationRemoved, LeaveUIState/EnterUIState and such Conditions are causing desync in Multiplayer. -->
<!-- Here we will go through every single quest/trigger and replace these conditions with alternatives that are MP compatible ... -.- -->

<!-- Info: -->
<!-- Tutorial Quests are not started for whatever reason, even when I set EnableTutorial=1 in GameSetup and even unlocking the Questpools for tutorial quests 150902,151339,151353,151382,151383,151384,151385,151386 -->
<!-- But I think they are not that helpful in MP anyways, because they are not clientside, so if one player eg. closes the popups, the others also can not read it and so on. -->
<!-- And it saves us ALOT of work, since we don't have to make them Desync-free here. -->
  <!-- (for the tutorial in intro session I still did the code, but it is not used by the game with disabled tutorial) -->
