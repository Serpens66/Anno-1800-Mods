1.01:
- Code improvement, less lag: Checking for reputation between AIs is now only done every 10 seconds instead every few miliseconds.
1.02:
- added LighthouseFix, so the mod still works when using eg. "Ruins on Takeover" Mod, by removing the AI lighthouse if it is owned by the player. (no longer needed, because Ruins on Takeover include that lightouse-remove code now)
1.03:
- code improvement: No longer needs to check for the AI-lighthouse to find out if a player is AI or not, so no incompatibility with the Runis on Takeover mod.
- code improvement: Now it are real alliances between the AIs including traderights (previously they had no traderights).
