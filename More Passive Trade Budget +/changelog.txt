1.01 
- forked from More Passive Trade Budget to include TradeFleet reduction and 40t capacity for merchant ships to compensate for higher budget.
1.02:
- Using save GUID range. This also means a one time savegame compatibilty break! Don't update if you already used this mod in your savegame!
1.03:
- Ai Merchants will change ships depending on game progress, since I found a way to remove the old ships (so they will no longer sum up to too many ships, so we can use more different ships, although they only differ in speed)
1.04:
- Update game version 16.1 and finally the TradeBudget will increase over time from 5k to 100k.
1.05:
- Increased Trade Budget even more, 100k in the latest Lategame is not enough.
