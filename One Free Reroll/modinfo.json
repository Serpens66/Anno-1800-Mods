    "Chinese": "First Reroll of Items every x minutes is free. Increasing costs are unchanged. Also reduced the -buy 20 items-restore intervall from 30 minutes to 10 minutes and increased the automatic items-change intervall from 5 minutes to 10 minutes. This way they are identical and the timer shown at the items page will be valid for both of it (for new games)",

    "German": "Das erste Neuwürfeln von Items bei Händlern alle x Minuten ist kostenlos. Jedes darauffolgende Neuwürfeln kostet weiterhin unverändert +5000. Das Intervall für den -nur 20 Items kaufbar-Reset wurde von 30 auf 10 Minuten reduziert und das Intervall welches automatisch die Items durchwechselt wurde von 5 auf 10 Minuten erhöht. Dadurch dass sie beide nun denselben Wert haben, gilt der angezeigte Timer im Spiel nun für beides (bei neuem Spiel)",
