1.01:
- Now also works at Nate

1.02:
- Now it should really work at Nate
- And again also at Isabel Sarmento
- Changed TraderRerollInterval from 5 minutes to 10 hours. Use free reroll instead if you want to change items.

1.03:
- code adjustments, now for sure only the default neutral traders are affected, no scenario merchants.

1.04:
- unfortunately "TraderRerollInterval" does not only affect the automatic change of offered itesm, but also when the trader offers new goods after reaching a new progression. So we should not set it to 10 hours or so.
  instead we will reduce ItemBuyLimitRestoreDuration from 30 minutes to 10 minutes and increase TraderRerollInterval from 5 minutes to 10 minutes.
  this way (at new games) the timer shown at the items page will also show the time when the items are automatically changed, so you know if it is worth to drive to the merchant, you have to hurry or if it is too late already, because it will switch soon.
