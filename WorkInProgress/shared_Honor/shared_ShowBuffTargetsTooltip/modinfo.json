  "Description": {
    "English": "When hovering over an active Buff, you now will always see tooltip with all buff targets if they are 5 or less direct targets listed in the buffs targets. This is still not perfect, but I think better than the bugged vanilla behaviour. In vanilla you dont see the targets tooltip, if the objects GUID is mentioned on the first level of a used EffectTargetPool, while it is shown if the object guid is on the second level or below.",
