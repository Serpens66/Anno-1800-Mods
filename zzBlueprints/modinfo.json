      "Chinese": "Blueprints from this mod do not work well with monuments (currently only Kaiserdom mod), therefore you will not be able to upgrade this blueprint.

Even an alwaystrue trigger with new GUID does not seem to trigger. So start a new game when enabling this mod or use version 1.01 of this mod.",

      "German": "Blaupausen von diesem Mod funktionieren nicht gut mit Monumenten (zurzeit nur Kaiserdom mod), daher lässt sich diese Blaupause nicht ausbauen. Entferne sie stattdessen und baue das richtige Fundament. Dieser Mod ist leider nicht kompatibel mit savegames, da er den Bau von Silos/Traktorscheunen verhindern wird. Nur mit neuem Spiel nutzen (oder Version 1.01 dieses Mods).",
