    "Chinese": "海盗塔 +~30% 伤害和 +50% 生命值\n双倍的生命值和海盗大枪伤害。\n海盗港的30k生命值，它与岛屿的道德更相关。\n海盗在每个阶段将增加~5艘船只，并且还有更多更高等级的船只。船只在一半的时间内建造完毕，如果附近，也会攻击你的战舰。\n他们将每 120 分钟（而不是 150 分钟）带着相当大的舰队回来（游戏后期有 10 艘战舰），并将在战斗后 10 分钟修复他们的基地。\n只有 20 分钟而不是 30 分钟来击败海盗舰队，然后他们再次安顿下来。\n停火只会持续 45 分钟，而不是 180 分钟（也适用于第二方）\n非攻击协议持续 90 分钟，而不是 4 小时。（也适用于第二方）\n像炮艇一样同时在造船厂解锁护卫舰，所以你在早期中期对抗海盗时有更好的机会。海盗还将建造战列巡洋舰和火焰喷射器监视器。您将与两个海盗开战，但会获得免费停火，因此即使遇到顽固的海盗，您仍然可以定居您的第一个岛屿。与海盗保持和平或更高的和平会变得更加昂贵，因为如果您不比他们强大多少，他们会要求付款以不定期取消条约。\n既不增加新船，也不给海盗船任何疯狂的增益。",

    "German": "Basis:\n- Piraten Türme machen ~30% mehr Schaden und haben 50% mehr Lebenspunkte.\n- Die Piraten Big Berta hat doppelte Lebenspunkte und Schaden.\n- Der Priatenhafen hat 30k Lebenspunkte und ist bzgl. Moral der Insel relevanter.\n- Gebäude reparieren sich 10 Minuten nach Ende des Kriegszustandes (also ~20 Minuten nach letztem Schuss), sofern Pirat nicht komplett besiegt wurde.\nSchiffe:\n- Piraten haben ~5 Schiffe mehr in ihrer Kriegsflotte und außerdem mehr hochstufige Schiffe, sie werden doppelt so schnell gebaut und greifen häufiger auch Kriegsschiffe in der Nähe an.\n- Nachdem Piraten besiegt wurden, kommen sie schon nach 120 (Statt 150) Minuten zurück mit einer deutlich größeren Flotte (10 Linienschiffe zum Zeitpunkt von Ingenieuren).\n- Die Quest die Piratenflotte vor dem Wiederaufbau zu besiegen, hat nur noch ein Zeitlimit von 20, anstelle von 30 Minuten.\nSonstiges:\n- Waffenstillstand dauert nur noch 45 Minuten anstatt 2 Stunden, dies gilt auch für KI Mitspieler.\n- Nichtangriffs-Pakt dauert nur noch 90 Minuten anstatt 4 Stunden, dies gilt auch für KI Mitspieler.\n- Alle Spieler können die Fregatte schon mit Arbeitern bauen, damit man anfangs etwas mehr Feuerkraft gegen die stärkeren Piraten hat. Piraten bauen nun auch Schlachtkreuzer und Flammenwerfer Monitor. Man startet im Krieg mit beiden Piraten, bekommt aber ein Angebot für kostenlosen Waffenstillstand, sodass man die erste Insel in Ruhe besiedeln kann. Frieden oder mehr mit den Piraten zu halten wird teurer, da dieser nun immer mal wieder Geld für die Aufrechterhaltung der Verträge verlangt, sofern man militärisch nicht deutlich überlegen ist. \nDer Mod fügt weder neuen Schiffe hinzu, noch gibt er den Piratenschiffen irgendendwelche verrückten Boni.",
