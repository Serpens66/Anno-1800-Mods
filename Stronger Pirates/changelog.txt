1.01:
- Made earlier Fregatte unlock savegame compatible.
1.02:
- made sure everything is compatible to game version 16.1
- Added flamethrower Monitor to Late (1) and Endgame (6) pirate Fleet
- slightly increased the combackfleet in Late and Endgame
1.03:
- comeback fleet in Late und Endgame now consists of ship of the line and monitor, instead of only one type.
- made counterproposals 3 times more expensive (eg. when you request ceasefire but the pirate does not like you enough to accept it for free). This may be adjusted in case ubisoft fixes the bug: that this cost do not scale with progress.
1.04:
- code adjustments and bugfix of 1.03 (counterproposal cost change most likely did not work in 1.03)
1.05:
- Added battlecrusier to the normal pirate fleet (1 in late und 3 in endgame).
- Increased amount of flamethrowers ships from pirates in Lategame from 1 to 3. 
- Increased archibald and sarmentos harbor range, so pirate avoids a bigger radius around them to not be targetet by the guns that often.
- Halfed the CraftingTime of the pirates ships, so they spawn them faster and doubled their selfheal when out of combat (still very slow).
- increased quest time limit to defeat comeback-fleet from 10 to 15 minutes (vanilla 30 minutes)
- If not in war with pirates, they have a 50% chance to ask every 30 minutes for money, if they are stronger than you. If not paid they will cancel treaties or even declare war, even if they liked you.
- If not in war and the pirates don't like you (anymore), they will only declare/threat war if they are at least half as strong as you (unless the reputation is below 1, then the strength does not matter)
