1.01:
- Made earlier Fregatte unlock savegame compatible.
1.02:
- made sure everything is compatible to game version 16.1
- Added flamethrower Monitor to Late (1) and Endgame (6) pirate Fleet
- slightly increased the combackfleet in Late and Endgame
1.03:
- comeback fleet in Late und Endgame now consists of ship of the line and monitor, instead of only one type.
- made counterproposals 3 times more expensive (eg. when you request ceasefire but the pirate does not like you enough to accept it for free). This may be adjusted in case ubisoft fixes the bug: that this cost do not scale with progress.
1.04:
- code adjustments and bugfix of 1.03 (counterproposal cost change most likely did not work in 1.03)
