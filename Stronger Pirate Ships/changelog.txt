1.01:
- Fixed a bug in code which caused no pirate ships in Earlygame if also my Stronger Pirates mod was active.
- Made the cheat item that makes pirate ships stronger, not researchable.
1.02:
- Reduced the comback fleet a bit more, if stronger pirates are enabled (previuosly it was ~50%, now it is ~40% of stronger pirates mod)
- increased chance for pirate ships to drop the default loot.
1.03:
- code improvement (faster loading)
- also reduced pirate trigger ship spawning in new world (forgot it) if stronger pirate mod is enabled
