1.01:
- changed code for the "building build warning fix" to be more in line with what was most likely intended by the devs, cause it looks like this in correct code of them
- now new mod buildings using godlike permits will also show a permit icon as buildcosts when you can afford it, just like the other godlike buildings.

1.02:
- added exportbin_FixTTAddSameOutput.include  tooltip for AdditionalOutput fixed, if it contains same output and another output in same effect.
