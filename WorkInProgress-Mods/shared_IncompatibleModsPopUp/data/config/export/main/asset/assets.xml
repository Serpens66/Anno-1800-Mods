  <!-- first idea was to display a "letter" (ActionTriggerTextPopup with TextPopupLayout=Letter), but there are several compatibility problems with this: -->
    <!-- it does close any already displayed letter (eg from other mods introducing their features) and also closes opened menus like statistic screen (which may be relevant for my lua-code-multiplayer check, that forces everyone into statistic screen at start of a game). -->
  <!-- Therefore I decided to use a real PopUp instead, although they are heavily limited by Enums (datasets.xml) and we have to abuse a vanilla one, -->
  <!-- while the only one that is not needed on PC is "ResetConsoleOptionsConfirmation" (there are no mods on console eg. PS4). -->
    <!-- I consider this "incompatible mods" message more important than any other usecase this PopUp could be used for, so I think it is fine to use it here. -->
 <!-- NEW 1.022: Now using a shared PopUp! can be used by multiple mods, as long as they dont want to display it at the same time!  -->


  <!-- info: a GUID of a trigger can be absued to also display text, so its the same GUID 1500005501 -->
  <!-- Using a FeatureUnlock here for Coop compatibility. -->
  <!-- Every mod using shared PopUp needs their own FeatureUnlock, because of problems in coop multiplayer. -->
   <!-- (there is no way to start this popup via lua, but lua is checking if the player hit a button. -->
    <!-- xml ActionTriggerPopup does start the popup for all coop players. So having 2 players who hit the button of previous -->
     <!-- PopUp at different timing might still rsult in sending the same PopUp twice) -->
