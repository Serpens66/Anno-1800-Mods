1.01:
- made lua code a bit more secure by using pcall() (without it, if an error in lua scripts event-Function happens, the game will crash)
1.02:
- load after new mod "shared_LuaTools_Medium_Serp" which can replace the shared_EventOnGameLoaded this mod requires (only one of them will be loaded)
- updated shared_EventOnGameLoaded
1.022:
- updated shared_EventOnGameLoaded (usage did not change, but made sure that the trigger does not fire when the mod gets deactivated. before it fired when it was deactivated, because non-existent GUIDs count as unlocked)
