  "Description": {
    "Chinese": "For Modders: Condition to check if processing player is any AI or specific AI or specific Human. The code uses the AI-specific lighthouse as main condition, but it will also make sure no human players are hit by this, even if they somehow controll such a lighthouse! To check for which human, the code will spawn a invisble fake object at start once and deletes it after few seconds.",

    "German": "Für Modder: Condition um zu prüfen ob der processing Spieler eine KI bzw. eine bestimmte KI ist oder nicht. Der Code nutzt den KI-spezifischen Leuchtturm als Bedingung, aber stellt gleichzeitg sicher, dass keine menschlichen Spieler getroffen werden, selbst wenn sie so einen Leuchtturm besitzen! Um rauszufinden wer welche Mensch ist, wird ein unsichtbares Fake object zu Beginn einmalig gespawned und nach wenigen Sekunden wieder entfernt.",
