1.01:
- added "g_LuaScriptBlockers" to the lua script. Only relevant if you are coding in lua (use it to make sure lua scripts are only executed once per local player also in Multiplayer)
- Note that this is mod-event not executed for AI! There is also no need for it, because OnGameLoaded is only really relevant for lua and AI can not execute lua scripts.
