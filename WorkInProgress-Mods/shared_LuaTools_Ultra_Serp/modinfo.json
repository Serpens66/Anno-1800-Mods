    "English": "For Modders: shared_LuaTools_Ultra_Serp. Includes very advanced lua features to find out who is which Peer and saving data to the savegame. It needs a short time (5-15 seconds) of initialization every time a multiplayer game is started, shows a notification. But if you accept this downside, it is very powerful to know who which peer is to write multiplayer compatible lua code. shared_LuaTools_Light_Serp and shared_LuaTools_Medium_Serp are included as shared mod."
