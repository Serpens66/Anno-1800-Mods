\n- Add English translation (thx LokiCharms).
\n- Add my new mod -MoreInfoTooltipsNew_Serp-. In a future update you will be able to see cargo of ships from spied players (and now already from allied players)
\n- New saboatage action: Add bad newspaper article to next newspaper (only makes sense against other humans)
\n- Add a 'Quest' which spawns a AI spy on your island if Rep is below 40. If you dont find and eliminate the spy within 10 minutes, sabotage will happen: bad news, steal money or bad reputation. So unlike the other AI spies you will have a Quest for this which shows you the island and the spy will not shoot at your buildings, but move around and only after the timelimit the sabotage will happen.
\n- several bugfixes:
\n- - Fix explosion doing no damage
\n- - Fix Easy setting to also properly reduce crafting time/costs in spy post building
\n- - using UniqueType for the barracks (Kaserne) building now, instead of my previous unfortunately unreliable code. Once per island.
\n- - Making the Participants Mercier and Pirates infectable by Incidents
1.004:
Add new Spy Action to spy at Kontor for Ship cargo documents, which makes the tooltip when hovering over other players ships display their cargo.\nMake the action 'Reputation Damage: Competitors' also work at Pirate Kontor, to damage the opinion for all AI competitors towards the targeted pirate.\nSpy Post building can now only be placed on foreign islands and added a 'Change Skin'-Button to it, for easier changing the appearance of it.\nFix 'CommandAlly'-DiploAction, I think it did not work.\nAdd spy action to infiltrate a ship, which makes it commandable for a short time (using the CommandAlly code).
