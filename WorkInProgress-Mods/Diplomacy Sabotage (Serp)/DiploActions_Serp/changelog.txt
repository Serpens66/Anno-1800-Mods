1.01:
- add MoreInfoTooltipsNew_Serp . This way you will be able to see the cargo of allied AI ships/human players you have the permission, when hovering over their ships.
- add Identifier to CommandAlly keybinds
1.011:
- adjust lua function CommandAllyAllowed, to also allow commanding if a spy effect is on the ship (sabotage mod)
- Improve the Code for requesting supportfleet, now it hopefully also works in advanced savegames.
