  <!-- Bug to fix: The Fire Incident on ships, using the Buff 192004 to display that fire is active,  -->
  <!-- does not display the Remaining Incident Duration, while Illness Buff 192986 does display it. -->
  
  <!-- Cause: The devs used the GUID 2001025 from the Fire Incident, instead 192004 from the Fire Buff -->
  
  <!-- (the only reason why these buffs, whch do nothing on their own, are added is to dsiply the remaining time. -->
   <!-- we dont need to add other incidents, since these buffs are usually granted by "CausedIncidentBuff", which only works for ships -->
    <!-- and in vanilla ships only can have fire/illness incident. In theory one could add more (riot/arcticillness) but then the mods adding this -->
     <!-- can add the tooltip code for them, since we have to hardcode the buff GUID here to only display the remaining time on them. -->
   
  <!-- GUID 25000102 is responsible for displaying buffs -->
