  "Description": {
    "English": "shared_LuaCoopCounter: Lua scripts are tricky in Multiplayer/Coop because scripts started with ActionExecuteScript are executed for each local player. So eg. 2 times if you play Coop with 2 humans. For MP with 2 seperate human players you can use my shared mod WhichPlayer to make sure your script is executed for the correct human. This mod here is for Coop. It provides a function to count how many coop players are active in the executing Participant."
