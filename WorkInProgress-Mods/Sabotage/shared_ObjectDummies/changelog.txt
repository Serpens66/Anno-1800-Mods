1.10 to 1.13:
- added shared mod shared_NatureParticipant_Serp 1.02 : a new participant that can be used for several dummy-like actions. It is neutral and has traderights with everyone (do never change this). Will be used as owner for volcano to not show a portait and stuff like this (if ever released). Initially thought could also be used as QuestGiver for Dummy Quest, but the SessionParticipant is not added automatically to savegames, so we wont use it for that purpose.
- added hint in templates.xml that you mgiht want to add your dummy objects to the exceptions of FunFactsCounter
- added Min_Shipyard_Serp
- added CharacterNotification_DummyCommand
- changed A7_QuestDummyQuest to use Scenario3_Challenger1 as default QuestGiver (does exist in all sessions in vanilla), to prevent possible problems with mods which might declare war against the Queen, which we used previously.
  changed QuestCategory to MetaQuest which seems to work fine, but does not start the "Quest started" Sound.
  added ResetPreconditionsAfterQuestWasTriggered , so by default PreConditions are reset.
1.14:
- Added empty graphic files for invisible objects (because InitialVisibility from Mesh does not always seem to work)
