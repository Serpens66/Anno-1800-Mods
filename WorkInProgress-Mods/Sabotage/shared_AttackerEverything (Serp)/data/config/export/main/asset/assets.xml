  <!-- unfortunaltey the Anno devs did not give modders ways to add more attacktypes. So we have to edit vanillas and use for other purposes -->
   <!-- Seamine is not very commonly used, also not at other mods and they still work fine as they should if they are allowed to attack everyhting (they can not move anyways) -->
  <!-- Did not include Seamine in sth else than CanDamageUntargeted, because sth that automatically shoots at seamines is normally not want someone wants -->
  
  <!-- CanDamageTargetedAttack mean you can command it to attack sth. -->
  <!-- CanDamageTargetedAutoAttack means it will automatically start shooting at if in range -->
  <!-- CanDamageUntargeted means you can eg. use items on your object to deal damage to sth, like mortar and such -->
  
  <!-- LIMITATION: -->
    <!-- "Anno devs hardcoded some limitations: Assets with BasicAttackType=HunterAirship only auto-shoots at objects with the Bombarder property. While Seamine (and maybe also others) won't auto shoot at objects with the Bombarder property, even if you added Airship into the CanAttackTable.", -->
      <!-- "German": "Leider haben die Anno Devs eine Limitierung hardcoded: Assets mit BasicAttackType=HunterAirship schießen nur automatisch auf Ziele die das Bombarder property haben. Während Seamine (und evlt andere) nicht automatisch auf Objekte mit Bombarder property schießen, also zb. Airships, auch wenn Airship zu der CanAttackTable zugefügt wurde." -->
  
  
  <!-- If AI should have such an object that can shoot at everything, keep in mind that they do ont check if they can reach sth. -->
   <!-- so a ship that is allowed to attack IslandBuilding will get stuck at the coast, trying to reach unreachable targets -->

  <!-- in theory we could also change Warship or HarbourTower, since they are basically identical in vanilla. So if we customize HarbourTower, we could give all towers the Warship type instead. -->
   <!-- but this also means we could get incompatible with other mods adding new towers.. we could load after all and also change the template of towers... -->
    <!-- but for now I will stick to Seamine and only touch HarbourTower if there is a good reason -->
