1.03:
- Changed the Audio on Ship completion to "Done", instead of "Ship constructed", to make it fit also for non-ship actions (text for german and english was/is already changed. other languages need translation)
1.04:
- Reduced the NotificationMinDisplayTime of that Ship constructed notification to 2.5 seconds
1.041:
- fixed construction time display if the object has no costs
1.042:
- also show the effects while the object is not unlocked (if unhidden)
- show the effects at the start of the tooltip
1.043:
- add new improved usage: Now just add the Buff Assets as EffectTargets GUID into your DummyShip. No need to copy past all buff-effects into your DummyShip anymore (still backwards compatible)
