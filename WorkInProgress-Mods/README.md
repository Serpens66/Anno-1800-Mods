# Anno 1800 Mods (WIP)
Mods for Anno 1800 I'm working on (Serp/Serpens66).

These mods are not released as playable mods yet! Some may be non functional or break your savegame!

The code is uploaded here for interested users/modders and you may try some to test and report back bugs or so.
Depending on the development state I may already be aware of bugs/problems.
These mods are also subject to frequent changes and testing, even without changing the version number!
They may be released some day (moved to the other folders) or may also never be released if I'm unable to finish them.

Download for testing (may break your savegame!):
Click on the green "Code" button on the top right and hit "download zip" to download the complete collection. Of course you can delete the mods you don't want after download (I know no way to only download a single folder from github).
