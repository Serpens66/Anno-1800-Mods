  "Description": {
    "English": "shared_LuaCoopPeers: Lua scripts are tricky in Multiplayer/Coop because scripts started with ActionExecuteScript are executed for each local player. So eg. 2 times if you play Coop with 2 humans. For MP with 2 seperate human players you can use my shared mod WhichPlayer to make sure your script is executed for the correct human. This mod here is for Coop. It will try to identify which coop-peer the local player is, so you can write better lua code to only exeucte it for one coop player, not all (for commands that are synced by the game)."
