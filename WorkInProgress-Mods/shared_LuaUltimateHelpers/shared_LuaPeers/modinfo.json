  "Description": {
    "English": "shared_LuaPeers: Lua scripts are tricky in Multiplayer/Coop because scripts started with ActionExecuteScript are executed for each local player and some commands snyc others not. So eg. 2 times if you play Coop with 2 humans. This mod identifies which peer the local player is and which peer is inactive, so you can write multiplayer compatible lua code."
