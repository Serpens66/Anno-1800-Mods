1.04:
- made sure the testobjects do not spawn loot when they are removed (by turning them neutral before deleting)
1.05:
- just to be sure a short delay after making them neutral and then deleting them
1.06:
- use lua code for humans instead of spawning helper stuff with xml. should be much better now.
1.07:
- remove the code for Mod1 to Mod20 and Human4 to Human7 Participants, because of the heavy dumy-spawn-code and they are only needed if modder add new Participants. Put this into another mod shared_WhichModPlayer instead.
1.08:
- use AlwaysTrue once as condition for the lua code that checks for Human (instead of SessionLoaded, because this does not work well for enabling it on savegames)
