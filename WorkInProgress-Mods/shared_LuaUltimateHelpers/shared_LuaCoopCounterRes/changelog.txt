1.01:
- updated shared_LuaOnGameLoaded to 1.01
1.02
- updated shared_LuaOnGameLoaded to 1.02
1.05 (updates 3 and 4 never done, because code did not work for inactive coops)
BREAKING (mods using older versions need update)
- renamed to shared_LuaCoopCounterRes_Serp
- now also checks the Res amount of other Human Participants
- new naming of (global) variables
- use shared_EventOnGameLoaded_Serp instead, because its easier
