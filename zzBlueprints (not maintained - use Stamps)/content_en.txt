Makes blueprints available at game start for the most relevant buildings. (without ability to build them, before unlocking the original)
Buildmenu icon from fishboss.
The mod itself is not savegamecompatible unfortunately, don't know why. Even an alawystrue trigger with new GUID does not seem to trigger. So start a new game when enabling this mod or use version 1.01 of this mod.
