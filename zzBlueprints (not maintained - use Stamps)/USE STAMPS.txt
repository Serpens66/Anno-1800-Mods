This mod is no longer needed and just here for reference.
You better use the new "stamps" from vanilla game. Go tocreative mod and create a stamp of every building you need (put a road in front, cause a single building does not work in a stamp).

Or you can use the stamp I upladed here "Stamps Single Buildings".
Simply copy them into your \Documents\Anno 1800\stamps folder.
