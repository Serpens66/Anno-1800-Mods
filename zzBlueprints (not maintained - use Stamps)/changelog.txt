1.01:
- changed folder name to zzBlueprints, so it loads after most other mods, to be able to make blueprints for mod buildings.
- Added Support for my mods: Small Powerplant and Kaiserdom. Now you can also place blueprints of them.
- Added Steam Shipyard.
1.02:
Added blueprints for Silo and Tractor modules, so you can plan a bit ahead. The blueprints do not change the required fields for farms (use shift instead to be able to place more fields than allowed, if you want to plan with more fields).
(unfortunately not savegame compatible for whatever reason =/)
1.03:
Added Silo and Tractor module strings to the blueprints. The mod itself is not savegamecompatible unfortunately, don't know why. Even an alawystrue trigger with new GUID does not seem to trigger.
1.04:
Fixed blueprint building costs from steam shipyard.
1.05:
Fixed Incidentbuildings for GU 16 (was not buildable since then)
