  "Description": {
    "Chinese": "使波雷亚斯飞艇（北极）受到与飞船相同的攻击。如果你拥有通道DLC，但不是天空帝国DLC，这个模组很好，所以你不能建造高射炮。",
    "English": "Makes Boreas airships (Arctic) attackable by same as ships. This mod is good if you own the Passage DLC, but not the Empire of the Skies DLC, so you can not build flak.",
    "French": "Makes Boreas airships (Arctic) attackable by same as ships. This mod is good if you own the Passage DLC, but not the Empire of the Skies DLC, so you can not build flak.",
    "German": "Macht Boreas Luftschiffe (Arktis) angreifbar von allem was auch Schiffe angreifen kann. Dieser Mod ist sinnvoll, wenn man das Passage DLC, aber nicht das Reich der Lüfte DLC besitzt und somit keine Flak bauen kann.",
