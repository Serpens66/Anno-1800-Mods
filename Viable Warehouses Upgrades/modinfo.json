    "German": "Warenhäuser erhöhen die Insellagerkapazität um 1/10/25/50 und jedes Upgrade erhöht die Wagen-slotmenge um +2.\nAußerdem werden die Baukosten für die höherwertigeren Upgrades drastisch reduziert und die Wartungskosten für die höchste Stufe von 500 auf 200 gesetzt.\nDies dient dem Ziel, das Upgraden von Warenhäusern halbwegs wirtschaftlich besser zu machen, anstatt ausschließlich viele Level 1 Warenhäuser zu bauen.",
