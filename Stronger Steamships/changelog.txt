1.01:
Great Eastern got 2 LoadingSpeedFactor and Cargo Ship 1.5.
1.02:
- Nerfed stationed flamethrowers and flamethrower monitor (and Pyrphorish) to make a little less damage overall (and reverted the BaseDamage increase from prior modversion), so it takes ~7 seconds instead of 3 to destroy a ship of the line... still overpowered I think :D 
- But fixed the problem of flamethrower monitor that it was unable to target moving targets at all.
- added the speed and hitpoint buff from this mod to flamethrower and flak monitor.
- 1.2 and 1.4 Loadingspeedbonus for the trade-only sailing ships schooner and clipper
1.03:
- code adjustments and removed the flamethrower monitor fix, should be fixed by gamedevs now instead.
