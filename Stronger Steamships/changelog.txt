1.01:
Great Eastern got 2 LoadingSpeedFactor and Cargo Ship 1.5.
1.02:
- Nerfed stationed flamethrowers and flamethrower monitor (and Pyrphorish) to make a little less damage overall (and reverted the BaseDamage increase from prior modversion), so it takes ~7 seconds instead of 3 to destroy a ship of the line... still overpowered I think :D 
- But fixed the problem of flamethrower monitor that it was unable to target moving targets at all.
- added the speed and hitpoint buff from this mod to flamethrower and flak monitor.
- 1.2 and 1.4 Loadingspeedbonus for the trade-only sailing ships schooner and clipper
1.03:
- code adjustments and removed the flamethrower monitor fix, should be fixed by gamedevs now instead.
1.04:
- Removed speed and hitpoint buff for the flamethrower ships, they are too strong already. Halfed the attack speed of flamethrower monitor. They are still very string against sailships, but at least easy target for steamships now.
1.05:
- removed code to nerf flamethrower-towers. This is now a separate mod: Nerf Flame-Armor-Towers
