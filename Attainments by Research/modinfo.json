    "Chinese": "成就而不是影响增益。当你不再需要它们时，使用研究点研究这些增益，而不是获得它们（类似于纪元 1404 中的荣誉）。唯一的例外是宣传爱好者。当学者选项卡中有工作人员时，您可以构建一种研究建筑。AI根据他们的进度获得增益。我强烈推荐我的模组 - 早期研究等等。鱼老板的建筑图形。",
    "English": "Attainments instead of Influence Buffs. Research those buffs with Researchpoints, instead of getting them, when you no longer need them with influence (similar to Honor in Anno 1404). Only exception is the Propaganda buff. You can build a kind of researchbuilding when having workers in the scholar tab. The AI gets the buffs based on their progress. I strongly recommend my mod -Early Research and more-. Building graphic by fishboss.",

    "German": "Errungenschaften anstatt Einfluss Buffs. Erforsche diese Buffs stattdessen mit Forschungspunkten, anstatt die Buffs mit Einfluss erst zu bekommen, wenn du sie nicht mehr brauchst (soll ähnlich zu Ruhm in 1404 sein). Einzige Ausnahme ist der Propaganda Buff. Du kannst eine Art Forschungsgebäude mit Arbeitern im Gelehrtentab bauen. Die KI bekommt die Buffs basierend auf ihrem Fortschritt. Ich empfehle dazu dringend meinen Mod -Early Research and more-. Gebäude Grafiken von fishboss.",
