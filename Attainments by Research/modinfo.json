    "English": "Attainments instead of Influence Buffs. Research those buffs with Researchpoints, instead of getting them, when you no longer need them with influence (similar to Honor in Anno 1404). Only exception is the Propaganda buff. You can build a kind of researchbuilding when having workers in the scholar tab. The AI gets the buffs based on their progress. I strongly recommend my mod -Early Research and more-. Building graphic by fishboss.",

    "German": "Errungenschaften anstatt Einfluss Buffs. Erforsche diese Buffs stattdessen mit Forschungspunkten, anstatt die Buffs mit Einfluss erst zu bekommen, wenn du sie nicht mehr brauchst (soll ähnlich zu Ruhm in 1404 sein). Einzige Ausnahme ist der Propaganda Buff. Du kannst eine Art Forschungsgebäude mit Arbeitern im Gelehrtentab bauen. Die KI bekommt die Buffs basierend auf ihrem Fortschritt. Ich empfehle dazu dringend meinen Mod -Early Research and more-. Gebäude Grafiken von fishboss.",
