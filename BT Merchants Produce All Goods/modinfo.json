  "Description": {
    "Chinese": "In Anno 1800 Passive Traders can only sell to you what they have in stock, but they -produce- only the goods you see at their active tradescreen. Everything else can only be sold to you, if the merchants bought it previously from you or another player. This mod adds a small production of every good of the merchants session to every merchant (0.4 per minute per progression since this good was unlocked), so you can buy every good with passively buy at least in small amounts (you may adjust the numbers in assets.xml if you want higher amounts). I recommend my mod -Display passive Tradegoods- so you are able to see how much goods the traders have in stock.",

    "German": "In Anno 1800 können die passiven Händler nur das verkaufen, was sie auch auf Lager haben, doch sie -produzieren- nur die Güter die du auch im aktiven Handel sehen kannst. Alle anderen Waren können dir auch im passiven Handel nur verkauft werden, wenn der Händler sie zuvor bei dir oder einem anderen Spieler kaufen konnte. Dieser Mod fügt eine Produktion einer kleiner Menge von jeder Ware von der Session des Händlers zu jedem Händler hinzu (0.4 pro Minute pro Entwicklungsstufe, die die Ware unlocked ist), damit du diese dann im Passivhandel kaufen kannst (du kannst die Mengen in der assets.xml bei Bedarf anpassen). I empfehle dazu noch meinen Mod -Display passive Tradegoods-, damit du im Aktivhandelsmenü einsehen kannst, wieviel von jeder Ware ein Händler auf Lager hat. ",
