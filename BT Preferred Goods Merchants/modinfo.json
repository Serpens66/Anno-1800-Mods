      "German": "Die Anzeige im Aktivhandel von den Händlern wird bei existierenden Spielen nicht geupdated. Dh. wenn du den Mod nachträglich zu einem Savegame zufügst, werden die bevorzugten Waren dort nicht angezeigt. Bzw. wenn du den Mod entfernst (nachdem du ihn in einem neuen Spiel aktiviert hattest), werden die Waren dort weiterhin angezeigt. Aber der Preismultiplikator ist immer korrekt, also ohne den Mod gibt es keine bevorzugten Preise auf diese Waren.",
