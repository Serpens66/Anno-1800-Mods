1.01:
- Added a little bit of variation for the Settle2ndIslandDelay value, since they all settled their 2nd island at exactly the same time.
- Also more variation for buying shares, so they dont buy at the same time.
1.02:
fixed more variation for 2nd island (not crucial, in 1.01 was just default time for smith and mercier, I fixed it to have individual time)
1.03:
Updated to Game Version 16.1
