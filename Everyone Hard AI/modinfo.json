  "Description": {
    "Chinese": Changes all AI opponents to hard difficulty, without changing their personality.\nSo mostly they will have better military (strength from Hunt).\nThe diplomacy is mostly unchanged but more expensive, so it will still be easy to get alliance with eg. Bente.\nAll AIs will have faster and cheaper ship Production (on hard they already have a bonus of 0.6. I will increase this even further to 0.5) and I doubled the max amount of ships. Every AI uses seamines around harbor. Besides that no changes, so eg. no new or buffed ships for the AI.,

    "German": "Wandelt alle KI Mitspieler in schwere KI um, ohne ihre Persönlichkeit zu stark zu ändern.\nAm auffälligsten ist das stärkere Militär (Stärke von Hunt).\nDiplomatische Aktionen sind größtenteils unverändert aber teurer, mit Bente alliiert zu sein ist zb weiterhin relativ leicht.\nAußerdem bekommen KI Mitspieler eine schnellere/günstigere Schiffsproduktion, von *0.6 auf *0.5 und die maximale Anzahl an Schiffen ist verdoppelt. Außerdem hat nun jede KI wie Hugo Mercier Seeminen um den Hafen. Abgesehen davon gibts keine Änderungen, also zb. keine neuen oder gebufften Schiffe für die KI.",
