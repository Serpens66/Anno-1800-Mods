  "Description": {
    "Chinese": "增加所选内容的最大矩形。允许复制和盖章尚未解锁的建筑物（例如，当您通过图章放置未解锁的蓝图时）。您仍然无法放置锁定的复制的单个蓝图（使用移液器），但是您可以在复制多个东西时放置它们。",
    "English": "Increases the max rectangle of selection. Allows to copy and stamp buildings that are not yet unlocked (eg. when you placed not-unocked blueprints via stamp). You still can not place locked copied single blueprints (with pipette), but you can place them when you copied more than one thing.",
    "French": "Increases the max rectangle of selection. Allows to copy and stamp buildings that are not yet unlocked (eg. when you placed not-unocked blueprints via stamp). You still can not place locked copied single blueprints (with pipette), but you can place them when you copied more than one thing.",
    "German": "Vergrößert das maximale Auswahlsdreieck. Erlaubt es Gebäude die noch nicht unlocked sind mit Pipette zu kopieren oder einen Stempel zu erstellen (zb. wenn sie durch einen Stempel platziert wurden). Man kann einzelne locked Gebäude mit der Pipette leider immernoch nicht platzieren, aber sobald es mehr als eines sind, gehts.",
