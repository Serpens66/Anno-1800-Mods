1.01
- Added the small powerplant to several triggers/Items/Effects where the game also uses the normal powerplant, to make the small one affected by the same effects.
1.02
- Made savegame compatible (building should unlock even if you you already had powerplants unlocked in savegame)
1.03
Added guid to more triggers/effect-lists. now all from the normal powerplant should be covered.
Using save GUID range. This also means a one time savegame compatibilty break! Don't update if you already used this mod in your savegame!
1.04
Forgot to adjust strings to new GUID, now the name of small powerplant is again displayed.
1.05:
fixed wrong path to graphic, was a breaking bug.
1.06:
Update for game version 1.61 (just a new GUID for the maintenance effectpool)
