Adds a Small Oil Powerplant in the old world.
It is smaller, needs 2/3 less workers and oil and also has 1/3 of the radius.

Is useful if you eg. have 4 oils on your island and need 2 areas with electricity. (since a normal powerplant needs 3 oil).

This is mostly extracted from Maugs Mod, so incompatible to his mod.


Not savegame compatible, so only works if you did not unlock powerplant already.
