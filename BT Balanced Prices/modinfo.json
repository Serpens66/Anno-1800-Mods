  "Description": {
    "Chinese": "将所有商品的所有基本价格调整为-每种产品的生产链维护成本除以0.8。通过这种方式，您可以在商家处以+-0的价格出售您的过剩生产，但仍然会损失空间/劳动力和一次性建筑成本。大多数商品会因为这个模组而变得更贵，除了许多残局和北极商品外，它们会变得更便宜。\n- 建造飞船需要花一点钱，你可以以平均总建造成本的 1.5 倍的价格出售它们（以基本价格包含材料）",
    "English": "- Adjusts all Baseprices of all Goods to -Maintenance costs of the production chain per product- divided by 0.8. This way you can sell your overproduction at +-0 at merchants, but still have the loss of space/workforce and one time building costs. Most goods will get more expensive with this mod, except many endgame and arctic goods, they get cheaper. \n- Ships cost a bit money to build, and you can sell them for average 1.5 times the total building costs (inculding materials at baseprice)",
    "French": "- Adjusts all Baseprices of all Goods to -Maintenance costs of the production chain per product- divided by 0.8.

    "German": "- Passt alle Basispreise von allen Waren an auf -Wartungskosten der herstellenden Gebäude- geteilt durch 0.8. Auf diese Weise kann man eine Überproduktion zu +-0 Bilanz verkaufen, hat aber dennoch den Verlust von Arbeitskraft und Platz. Die meisten Dinge werden durch diesen Mod teurer, abgesehen von Endgame und den meisten Arktis Produkten, diese werden oft günstiger. \n- Schiffe zu bauen kostet nun auch ein wenig Geld. Die Verkaufspreise der Schiffe wurden an die Produktionskosten angeglichen, sodass man beim Verkauf *1.5 dieser Kosten bekommt (die neuen Basispreise der Baumaterialien inbegriffen).",
