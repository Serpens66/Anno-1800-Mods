  "Description": {
    "Chinese": "- Adjusts all Baseprices of all Goods to -Maintenance costs of the production chain per product- divided by 0.8. This way you can sell your overproduction at +-0 at merchants, but still have the loss of space/workforce and one time building costs. Most goods will get more expensive with this mod, except many endgame and arctic goods, they get cheaper. \n- Ships cost a bit money to build, and you can sell them for average 1.5 times the total building costs (inculding materials at baseprice)",

    "German": "- Passt alle Basispreise von allen Waren an auf -Wartungskosten der herstellenden Gebäude- geteilt durch 0.8. Auf diese Weise kann man eine Überproduktion zu +-0 Bilanz verkaufen, hat aber dennoch den Verlust von Arbeitskraft und Platz. Die meisten Dinge werden durch diesen Mod teurer, abgesehen von Endgame und den meisten Arktis Produkten, diese werden oft günstiger. \n- Schiffe zu bauen kostet nun auch ein wenig Geld. Die Verkaufspreise der Schiffe wurden an die Produktionskosten angeglichen, sodass man beim Verkauf *1.5 dieser Kosten bekommt (die neuen Basispreise der Baumaterialien inbegriffen).",
