1.01:
- Code fixes
1.02:
- Nerfed the amounts to buy a bit, roughly ~20% less. Goal is that you can not completely waive a whole production chain, but require less if you buy some from the traders.
1.03:
- Now overwrites GoodsProduction value if it already exists (eg. from my Produce all goods mod).
