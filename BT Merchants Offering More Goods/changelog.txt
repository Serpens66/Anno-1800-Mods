1.01:
- Code fixes
1.02:
- Nerfed the amounts to buy a bit, roughly ~20% less. Goal is that you can not completely waive a whole production chain, but require less if you buy some from the traders.
1.03:
- Now overwrites GoodsProduction value if it already exists (eg. from my Produce all goods mod).
1.04:
- code improvements and now all merchants should start offering the goods only within the same timeframe when you unlock the goods.
- Linen instead of Tailored Suits from Kahina
- added some more goods to pirates and old world has 2 other goods than pirate new world
- reduced amounts again a bit for some things. 
1.05:
- more small amount adjustments
1.06:
- added Paper and Salt to Ketema
