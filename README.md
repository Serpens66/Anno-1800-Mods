# Anno 1800 Mods
Mods for Anno 1800 created by me (Serp/Serpens66).
You can open the modinfo.json file of each mod for an explanation what it does (should be displayed automatically when you use a modmanager).

Game Version Compatibility
-
Mods should all work with Game Version 18.


How to Download  
-
I uploaded most of my mods at mod.io: 
**https://mod.io/g/anno-1800/u/serp66**

You can also find them in the Anno 1800 ingame ModBrowser by searching for "Serp".

Or:

Click on the green "Code" button on the top right and hit "download zip" to download the complete collection. Of course you can delete the mods you don't want after download (I know no way to only download a single folder from github).

Usage  
-
Modloader no longer required. Simply put the mods you want to use into your "Documents/Anno 1800/mods" folder (create it if it does not exist) and start the game. Make sure you have either only the zip file of a mod or only the unpacked folder of the mod here, otherwise the mod may load twice.
Or simply subscribe/download my mods at mod.io.

Do NOT simply use all the mods from here at once, some might be incomaptible to each other! You can use "I mod your Anno (IMYA) mod-manager or take a look at the Documents\Anno 1800\log\mod-loader.log after starting the game or read the modinfo.json file to see incompatible mods (if they are marked to be incompatible by the author).


Coming Changes:
- Change "Preferred Goods" mod a bit, especially adding some of the newer DLC products.
- change the Attainments by Research to Attainments by Honor.

Planned Mods:
- Sabotage Mod
- Request Support Fleet Mod, combined with Honor
- and other mods in the WIP folder

Please report back any bugs and if the mods do well with a mod manager, cause I did not test the new modinfo.json format.

Using/Uploading my code/mods:  
-
Always ask me for permission before using code/uploading them anywhere. You can try to contact me here at github, eg. in the "issues" section or "Serp" in the anno modding discord (see invitation link below). Only if I do not respond within 1 month you are allowed to use/change my code/mods, but always with credits by mentioning me and linking to the source, eg. this github page.
