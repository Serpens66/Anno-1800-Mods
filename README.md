# Anno 1800 Mods
Mods for Anno 1800 created by me (Serp/Serpens66).
You can open the modinfo.json file of each mod for an explanation what it does (should be displayed automatically when you use a modmanager).

Game Version Compatibility
-
Mods should all work with Game Version 17.


How to Download  
-
Click on the green "Code" button on the top right and hit "download zip" to download the complete collection. Of course you can delete the mods you don't want after download (I know no way to only download a single folder from github).

Usage  
-
Modloader no longer required. Simply put the mods you want to use into your "Documents/Anno 1800/mods" folder (create it if it does not exist) and start the game. Make sure you have either only the zip file of a mod or only the unpacked folder of the mod here, otherwise the mod may load twice.


Coming Changes:
- Change "Preferred Goods" mod a bit, especially adding some of the newer DLC products.

Planned Mods:
-

Please report back any bugs and if the mods do well with a mod manager, cause I did not test the new modinfo.json format.
