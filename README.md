# Anno 1800 Mods
Mods for Anno 1800 created by me (Serp/Serpens66).
You can open the modinfo.json file of each mod for an explanation what it does (should be displayed automatically when you use a modmanager).

Game Version Compatibility
-
Most Mods should work with Game Version 16.1.
Mods I still need to check and fix for that version are:
- Attainments by Research
- Balanced Trading
- zzBlueprints

How to Download  
-
Click on the green "Code" button on the top right and hit "download zip" to download the complete collection. Of course you can delete the mods you don't want after download (I know no way to only download a single folder from github).

Please report back any bugs and if the mods do well with a mod manager, cause I did not test the new modinfo.json format.
