  "Description": {
    "Chinese": "装载码头的装载速度翻倍，高级装载码头的装载速度 *1.5。高级层的维护成本在每个区域中相等，为 500 而不是 1500。正常的码头维护成本为 100 而不是 50。",
    "English": "Doubles the loadingspeed of loadingpiers and *1.5 for advanced loading piers. Maintenance costs of advanced tier are equal in each region and 500 instead of 1500. And normal pier maintenance costs of 100 instead of 50.",

    "German": "Verdoppelt die Ladegeschwindigkeit von Anlegestellen (sind jetzt so schnell wie Kontorstufe 3) und erhöht die Ladegeschwindeigkeit von verbesserten Piers von 4 auf 6, womit sie ein wenig schneller als Kontorstufe 4 sind. Wartungskosten für die verbesserten Anlegestellen sind in jeder Region gleich und betragen 500, anstelle von 1500 (bzw. 50 artkis, was vermutlich ein bug ist). Für normale Anlegestellen Wartungskosten 100 statt 50.",
